DataCrafters' group work about football Open Data.

URLs of the datasets:
* https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jashsheth5/indepth-soccer-statistics-xg-xa-and-more <br>
  Our main source. The dataset contains detailed seasonal statistics for every player from top European leagues from season 14/15 to season 19/20.
* https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/davidcariboo/player-scores <br>
  From here we have used overall information about players and teams, and player appearances to help us matching between different sources. <br>
  The source of these data is Transfermarkt, and they come along TM IDs of players and clubs, which are extremely useful for matching purposes.
* https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kriegsmaschine/soccer-players-values-and-their-statistics/  <br>
  We have used this dataset to compute split statistics about players switching team during a season. It contains detailed data from season 17/18 to season 19/20, although it's not exhaustive in terms of players. <br>
